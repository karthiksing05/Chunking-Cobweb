# Data Documentation

A helper file where I can document how each folder's LTM was manually trained. Note that I had to delete a lot of old grammars because of the restructuring of separating each attribute.

*   `grammar2_fullparse_ct2/` - a manually trained LTM with 10 parse trees of "NP V" and "NP V NP" sentences where noun phrases were grouped first and the verb was grouped with the left noun phrase. The context length was 2.
